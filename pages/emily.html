                        After 12 years of dance training, I finally get the
                        pointe of it. Please note, this really bad pun was
                        written by my dad, because he is the one who has edit
                        access to this page. However, I get to choose his
                        retirement home!

                    <p>
                        Does one ever get a second chance at Fame? Yes, at least
                        as far as school plays go. I did Fame when I was in 4th
                        grade, and this year I got to do it all over again. This
                        was my final show at Elmwood Franklin School. Thanks so
                        much for the wonderful memories, and a special thanks to
                        Mrs Cooke-MacVittae who directed me in 19 shows. Truly
                        the end of an era for me.

                        I have an idea for a television show. I feel it could
                        involve Paris, and my name. Maybe "Emily goes to live in
                        a city in Europe". The title still needs some work, but
                        if you get the chance to visit Paris, you will not be
                        disappointed.

                        Every two years the residents of Ocean City MD.
                        experience a blizzard of sequines and hairspray when
                        teams of competitive dancers decend upon the convention
                        centre. This year our opening routine "Disco Fever" was
                        selected for the "Battle of the Stars". Huge fun, and
                        thanks to all my teachers for their amazing work.
