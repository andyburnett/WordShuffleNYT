                        As the youngest child in a family of five, I didn't
                        always have people to play with. Fortunately, the von
                        Trapp Family were always around, and never let me down.
                        This summer I had the chance to visit Salzburg and live
                        out my dreams. Was there singing and dancing - oooooh
                        yes!

                        John Cabra, and I have wanted to write a book about
                        creativity and Higher Education for a long time. This
                        year we finally managed to get the book finished and
                        published. To celebrate this milestone, I am going to go
                        off and write another book.

                        Matt Worwood and I have been working on the Fueling
                        Creativity and Education podcast for four years. And,
                        this year was the first time we had a chance to record
                        in person. Oh, and the 193 is the number of episodes we
                        have recorded so far.

                        Everyone goes through stages in life, I have reached the
                        stage where every gnome I meet must be suitably huged
                        and probably brought home to add to our collection.
