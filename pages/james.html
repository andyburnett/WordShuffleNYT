                        Although the connection is obvious, just in case anyone
                        is confused... We went to Zurich and the good citizens
                        of that amazing city have got electric scooters. The
                        scooters are called Lime bikes, I used one of the
                        scooters to go to a hairdresser. He gave me the best
                        haircut of my life - sorry Supercuts - and I am
                        expecting to get a lot of frequent flyer miles, based on
                        the number haircuts I need each year.

                        Probably not the one you were thinking about. We had an
                        amazing time at the competition, and I am really looking
                        forward to being back there in a few months.

                        Ever wondered about the most efficient way to make a
                        robot traverse a play field? Of course you have, because
                        it is a fascinating topic. I spent a lot time this year
                        pondering the mathematics of this question, and I would
                        be delighted to tell you all about it. No, it's no
                        trouble at all. Let me just get my slides. Wait, don't
                        leave. Or, if you have to leave at least move in a
                        mathemaically efficient way!

                        Poetry is not something I thought would interest me.
                        However, this year I had to write a poetry paper, and I
                        was amazed to discover that it is actually really
                        engaging. A big thank you to my English teacher, Mr.
                        Potter for shining a light on this subject. Of course,
                        splines are still way more interesting. In fact, I have
                        a lecture all about them.
