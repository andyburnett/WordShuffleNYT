                        Emily is very concerned about her impact on the world.
                        For this reason she has now decided to walk around on
                        the tippy-toes, and has purchased special shoes to make
                        it easier.

                    <img src="../images/fame.png" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                    <p>
                        Does one ever get a second chance at Fame? Yes, at least
                        as far as school plays go. Emily did Fame when she was
                        in 4th grade, and this year she got to do it all over
                        again.

                    <p>
                        Paris was amazing, and the Effiel tower is truly
                        astonishing, particularly at night.
