                        On our way to Austria, Cyndi downloaded the Duolingo
                        app. She thought it would be a good idea to learn to
                        speak German. We had a few hours on the flight, so we
                        both thought it would reasonably easy to become
                        moderately fluent. As it happens, German is a bit more
                        complicated than we expected! However, our exposure to
                        Duolingo and its very very clever gamification of
                        learning has resulted in us both becoming rather
                        obsessed with keeping our streaks going.

                        I love Les Miserables. We had an extra day in London,
                        and we were able to get tickets for the production at
                        the Sondheim Theatre in the West End. If you happen find
                        yourself in London, we cannot recommend it highly
                        enough. Quite astonishing.

                        The time has come to start looking at universities for
                        James. We weren't sure where to start, but James's old
                        mathematics tutor was now at Cornell, so we thought we
                        would take a trip to Ithaca, and tour the university.

                        I would imagine that Cornell can look a bit uninspiring
                        on a rainy day in February, but when we went it was an
                        absolutely perfect autumnal day. It is the sort day that
                        university recruiters long for, and it is fair to say
                        that we were impressed!

                        Niagara-on-the-Lake is beautiful. It also has some
                        fabulous restaurants. So, we decided to rent a cottage
                        for a few days, and enjoy the combination of the scenary
                        and the food. Perfect getaway.
